# Chess AI Optimization: MCTS & Alpha-Beta Pruning

This project focuses on optimizing Chess AI capabilities using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and Alpha-Beta Pruning techniques. Implemented in Python, the AI competes against human players and other AIs, showcasing advanced decision-making and strategic depth. Explore how these algorithms improve game performance and their practical applications in artificial intelligence.

## Project Overview

- **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)**: A heuristic search algorithm for decision processes, particularly effective in game AI.
- **Alpha-Beta Pruning**: An optimization technique for minimax algorithms, used to decrease the number of nodes evaluated in the search tree.
- **AI Competition**: The AI competes against human players and other AIs, demonstrating its enhanced strategy and performance.

## Features

- **Enhanced Decision-Making**: Implements MCTS and Alpha-Beta Pruning to improve the AIâ€™s ability to make strategic decisions in complex game scenarios.
- **Competitive AI**: The AI is capable of competing at different difficulty levels, offering a challenging experience for players.
- **Python Implementation**: The project is fully implemented in Python, ensuring flexibility and ease of integration.

## How It Works

### Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)

MCTS is used to explore possible moves by simulating many random games and selecting the move that leads to the best outcome. The algorithm involves four key steps:

1. **Selection**: Choose the node to explore based on a balance of exploration and exploitation.
2. **Expansion**: Add one or more child nodes to expand the tree.
3. **Simulation**: Play out a random simulation from the newly added node.
4. **Backpropagation**: Update the values of nodes based on the simulation results.

### Alpha-Beta Pruning

Alpha-Beta Pruning is applied to minimize the number of nodes evaluated in the minimax algorithm's search tree. It eliminates branches that do not influence the final decision, thereby optimizing the decision-making process.
